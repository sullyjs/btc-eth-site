Hey Arkus, 
this is what i ended up making, im not completely sure this is what you wanted, 
so if you think it's bad, let me know. i will redo or change things asap.

content wise:
- 5 pages: home, btc, ltc, eth, and about us [blank]
- dropdown: a dropdown, which i made in form of a hamburger, 
    which will take you to different specific parts of a page. 
    i also added in index.html how you'd have to do it, if you want to add more yourself.
- you didnt ask me this, but i made different text boxes as well.
- different image kinds are placed througout the doc too
